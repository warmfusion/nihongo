Counting up from 10 simply takes the form of `X ju Y` where `X` is the tens and `Y` is the units, eg 29 is `ni ju kyu`

### Subtleties

- Hatachi - Twenty but only used when talking about age
- yon/shi - Yon used almost always, shi more formal generally avoided as shi sounds like the word for 'death'
- schichi/nana - shichi used for time, nana used in phone numbers... don't know more yet
